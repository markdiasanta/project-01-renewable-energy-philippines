## Relevance to Philippine Data Projects
This data source is valuable for various data-driven projects in the Philippines, including:
- Policy Development: Enables government agencies and policymakers to design evidence-based guidelines and energy policies to improve national energy production and sustainability.
- Identifying Opportunities: Helps uncover potential untapped or underutilized energy sources across the country, supporting future investments.
- Progress Evaluation: Provides insights into the Philippinesâ€™ transition toward renewable energy by evaluating trends and shifts in energy generation over the years.

## Known Issues or Limitations
- Outdated Data: The latest entry in this dataset is from 2020. Given the rapid advancements in technology and renewable energy in recent years, this may not reflect the current energy landscape or trends in the Philippines.
- No Geographical Context: The dataset does not specify the location of power sources. Since the Philippines is an archipelago, not all energy sources are suitable or feasible in every region. Even if we identify the most productive source, it may not be viable in certain areas due to local geography or infrastructure limitations.
